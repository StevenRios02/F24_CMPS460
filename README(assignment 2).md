This program is intended for anyone who desires to simulate a deadlock check while allocating 
resources to different processes. This simulation runs through three different processes that
request three different resources. The program then checks whether enough units are available
to use its respective resources. In this simulation, there is no deadlock detected as only one 
process is waiting.

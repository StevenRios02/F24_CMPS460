This program goes through four different CPU scheduling algorithms; FCFS (first come first serve), SJF (shortest job first), SRT (shortest remaining time), and RR (Round Robin).
The program helps understand how each scheduling algorithm manages process execution and compares their performance based on waiting time and turnaround time. This program will 
calculate the average waiting and turnaround times for each of the scheduling algorithms.
